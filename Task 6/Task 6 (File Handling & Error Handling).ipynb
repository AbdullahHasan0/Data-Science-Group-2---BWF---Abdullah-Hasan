    "1. File Handling Support: Python allows users to read and write files easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplicity: Python's file handling is straightforward compared to other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. File Types: Python differentiates between text and binary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Text Files: Lines in text files are sequences of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. End of Line (EOL) Characters: Special characters, like commas or newlines, terminate each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Read and Write Operations: Basic operations include reading from and writing to files.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ease of Use: Python's file handling is both powerful and user-friendly.\n",

    "- r+:  To read and write data into the file. This mode does not override the existing data, but you can modify the data starting from the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- w+: To write and read data. It overwrites the previous file if one exists, it will truncate the file to zero length or create a file if it does not exist.\n",
