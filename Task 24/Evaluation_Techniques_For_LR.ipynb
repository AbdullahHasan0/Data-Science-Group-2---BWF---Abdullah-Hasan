    "#### What are Evaluation Techniques ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation techniques are essential for assessing the performance of regression models. They help identify the best model and tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy. Here are some common evaluation techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to the Mean Squared Error (MSE).   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it more suitable for situations where outliers are more important.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric calculates the square root of the Mean Squared Error. It is similar to MSE, but it's more interpretable as it's in the same units as the target variable.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE): This metric calculates the square root of the Mean Squared Log Error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. R-squared: This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit and 0 indicates no fit. R-squared can be used to compare different regression models and determine the best-fit model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adjusted R-squared: This metric is similar to R-squared, but it accounts for the number of features in the model. It helps to determine the performance of the model in a more controlled environment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Confidence Intervals: These are used to estimate the uncertainty in the predicted values. They provide a range of values that the true value is likely to fall within.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Cross-Validation: This technique divides the dataset into multiple subsets, trains the model on a subset, and evaluates its performance on the remaining subset. It helps to estimate the model's performance on unseen data and provides a more accurate measure of its performance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Residual Plots: These plots help to identify any patterns or trends in the residuals (errors) of the model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Leverage Points: These are data points that have a high leverage on the regression line. They can be influential in determining the model's performance and should be carefully examined.   \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "11. Influential Observations: These are data points that have a substantial impact on the regression model, either by having a large impact on the predicted values or by having a strong influence on the model's parameters. They should be removed from the dataset before training the model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluation techniques can help you compare different regression models, tune hyperparameters, and make informed decisions about the performance of your predictive models.\n",

    "The residual plot shows a scatter plot of the predicted salary (on the x-axis) versus the residuals (on the y-axis). If the model is a good fit, the residuals should be randomly scattered around the horizontal line at zero. However, if there are any patterns or outliers, they may indicate that the model's assumptions are not met. In this case, it seems that there may be some heteroscedasticity in the residuals, meaning that the variance of the residuals may not be constant across the range of predicted salaries. This could potentially affect the accuracy of the model's predictions.\n"
