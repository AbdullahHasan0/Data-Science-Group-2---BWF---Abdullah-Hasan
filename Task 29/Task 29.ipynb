    "<h3> What is the hyperparameter ?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learned within the model training process but are set beforehand. They can significantly impact the model's performance, including the convergence speed, the quality of the predictions, and the ability to generalize to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> How do we choose hyperparameters?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing hyperparameters requires a careful and systematic approach. Here are some strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grid Search: This method involves systematically testing different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the combination that produces the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Search: This method also involves testing different combinations of hyperparameters, but it randomly selects combinations instead of systematically testing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-Validation: This method involves dividing the dataset into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining subset. The performance is then averaged over the k iterations.\n"
